## Overview
Our team selected to use a dataset from Kaggle titled IBM Transactions for Anti Money Laundering. We elected to use the .txt files because we found the.csv was too large to push through GitHub. The txt file is comma delineated so we will convert it to a data frame. We will use MongoDB to build our database.

## Databases Created
- SQLite
- MongoDB
